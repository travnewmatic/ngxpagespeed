# [Basically this](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/build_ngx_pagespeed_from_source)
- I don't have a strong command of writing Dockerfiles
- I don't have a strong command of much anything else
- Adjust the `--nginx-version` to taste.  At the time of writing, I had an issue with the current `latest` nginx version.
- There are probably more tweaks to the Dockerfile that will be made/should be made.  Definitely a work in progress.
